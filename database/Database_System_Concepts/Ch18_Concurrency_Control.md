>     1. 2pl
>     2. timestamp-based approach
>     3. MVCC 
>        1. Snapshot isolation

> * If you are new to it, ...
> * If you already knew something about it, ... 
>   > tip: think more and read less in this case

>   > 1. If you design the thing from scratch, how would you do this?
>   > 2. If several solutions/approaches/implementations are introduced for the 
>   >    same issue/problem, compare them and list their pros and cons.

>   1. Understand the idea of these approaches 
>   2. QUES: 2pl and snapshot isolation are the most commonly used approaches, why?
>   3. The pros and cons of these approaches
