1. Every access method (regardless of its type) has an entry in system 
   catalog `pg_am`:
   
   ```sql
   steve=# select * from pg_am;
    oid  | amname |      amhandler       | amtype
   ------+--------+----------------------+--------
       2 | heap   | heap_tableam_handler | t
     403 | btree  | bthandler            | i
     405 | hash   | hashhandler          | i
     783 | gist   | gisthandler          | i
    2742 | gin    | ginhandler           | i
    4000 | spgist | spghandler           | i
    3580 | brin   | brinhandler          | i
   (7 rows)
   ```
   
   An entry contains:
   
   * name: the name of the AM
   * handler: a function that returns the defined  `struct IndexAmRoutine`. 
     It will takes a dummy argument of type `internal` to prevent it from 
     being accidentially called in normal SQL. The returned struct has to
     be `palloc()`'d:
     
     In Rust, it will be typically like:
     
     ```rust
     #[pg_extern(sql = "
     CREATE FUNCTION bm25_handler(internal) RETURNS index_am_handler PARALLEL SAFE IMMUTABLE STRICT COST 0.0001 LANGUAGE c AS 'MODULE_PATHNAME', '@FUNCTION_NAME@';
     CREATE ACCESS METHOD bm25 TYPE INDEX HANDLER bm25_handler;
     COMMENT ON ACCESS METHOD bm25 IS 'bm25 index access method';
     ")]
     fn bm25_handler(_fcinfo: pg_sys::FunctionCallInfo) -> PgBox<pg_sys::IndexAmRoutine> 
     ```
     
     
   * type: it is a table or an index
   
2. The non-pointer type fields of `struct IndexAmRoutine`

   * `NodeTag type`: has to be `NodeTag::T_IndexAmRoutine`
   
     > Emm, interesting, if the value is fixed, then why do we need to specify it.
     >
     > Possible answer, I guess it will be type-erased.
     
   * `uint16 amstrategies`: Total number of strategies (operators) by which we
     can traverse/search this AM. Zero if AM does not have a fixed set of strategies 
     assignments.
     
     > QUES: If I have mutliple OPERATOR CLASSes specified for this index am, 
     > then the value set in this field should be their operators' sum, right?
     
   * `uint16 amsupport`: total number of support functios that this AM uses. 
   
   * `uint16 amoptsprocnum`: opclass options support function number or 0.
   
     > QUES: what is this?
     
   * `bool amcanorder`: does AM support `ORDER BY` indexed column's value? 
   
     > QUES: what is this?
     
   * `bool amcanorderbyop`: does AM support `ORDER BY` result of an operator on
     indexed column. 
     
     > QUES: what is this and what's the difference between this and `amcanorder`?
     
   * `bool amcanbackward`: does AM support backward scanning?
   
   * `bool amcanunique`: does AM support `UNIQUE` indexes
   
      > QUES: what is this?
      >
      > I thought this sign indicates if this index can be used to deduplicate
      > data, then hash index can definitely be used for that, I checked hash
      > index's source code, but [this field is set to `false`][hash_canunique]
      >
      > [hash_canunique]: https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/2453196107de66cff0257feef2ff8585dcf9d924/src/backend/access/hash/hash.c#L67
      
      > This field will be mostly talked about in section [62.5](./62.5_Index_Uniqueness_Checks.md)
      
   * `bool amcanmulticol`: does AM support multi-column indexes
   
   * `bool amoptionalkey`: does AM require scans to have a constraint on the first
     index column?
     
     > QUES: what is this?
     >
     > What does "constraint" mean here? "fist index column", so this is field
     > only makes sense if your index support multi-column scan?
     
   * `bool amsearcharray`: does AM handle `ScalarArrayOpExpr` quals?
   
     > `ScalarArrayOpExpr` refers to expressions like:
     >
     > 1. `item in array[]`
     > 2. `item = ANY(ARRAY[])`
     >
     > It is literally "searching" the `array` for `item`, so this field is called
     > `searcharray`.
     
     > `qual` means: 
     
   * `bool amsearchnulls`: does AM handle `IS NULL/IS NOT NULL` quals  
   
     > Can this index be used for queries like "SELECT * FROM foo WHERE col IS NULL".
     
   * `bool amstorage`: can indx storage data type differs from column data type
   
     > QUES: I don't quite understand this, but the `GIN` index has it set to true 
     
   * `bool amclusterable`: can an index of this type be clustered on
   
     > Postgres's [`CLUSTER`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-cluster.html)
     > command sorts the table based on the order of an index, though it won't maintain
     > the state for you.
     
     > QUES:
     >
     > 1. If the index is an ordered index, then this field can be set to true?
     > 2. I think this is also related to the Table AM used by the table, what if
     >    it is a columnar format.
     
    * `bool ampredlocks`: does AM handle predicate locks?
    
      > From AI:
      >
      > This field indicates whether the access method supports "predicate locks". 
      > Predicate locks are a mechanism used in PostgreSQL to implement 
      > Serializable Isolation Level.
      >
      > Predicate locks are different from traditional row-level locks. Instead 
      > of locking specific rows, they lock the conditions (predicates) used to 
      > access data. This allows PostgreSQL to detect and prevent phantoms and 
      > write skew anomalies in serializable transactions.
      >
      > For example, if a transaction runs a query like "SELECT * FROM table 
      > WHERE x > 10", a predicate lock would be placed on the condition "x > 10". 
      > This prevents other transactions from inserting, updating, or deleting 
      > any rows that would satisfy this condition until the first transaction 
      > completes.
      >
      > Access methods that support predicate locks can provide more fine-grained 
      > concurrency control in serializable transactions, potentially improving 
      > performance in highly concurrent environments.
      
    * `bool amcanparallel`: does AM support parallel scan?
    
      > QUES: I think I understand the meaning of this field, but I don't understand
      > how parallel scan works in Postgres.
      
    * `bool amcanbuildparallel`: does AM support parallel build
    
      > QUES: I think I understand the meaning of this field, but I don't understand
      > how parallel index build works in Postgres.
      
    * `bool amcaninclude`: does AM support columns included with clause `INCLUDE`?  
    
      > QUES: have no idea what `INCLUDE` clause is
      >
      > [inlcude columns in btree indexes](https://use-the-index-luke.com/blog/2019-04/include-columns-in-btree-indexes)
      
    * `bool amusemaintenanceworkmem`: does AM use maintenance_work_mem
    
      > What is `maintenance_work_mem`: memory to be used by maintenance operations,
      > such as `VACUUM`, `CREATE INDEX`, and `ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY`.
     
    * `bool amsummarizing`: does AM summarize tuples, with at least all tuples 
      in the block summarized in one summary
      
      > QUES: no idea what "summary" means here
      
    * `uint8 amparallelvacuumoptions`: a bitflat, OR of parallel vacuum flags.
    
      > flags for parallel vacuum are defined in:
      >
      > https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/d5ca15ee54bf7faf038a38408e8adec971740966/src/include/commands/vacuum.h#L29-L69
    
    * `Oid amkeytype`: type of data stored in index, or InvalidOid if variable.
    
      > QUES: if `amstorage` is false, then I guess this field has to be the 
      > column type's Oid.

3. When you define an index, it has an entry in `pg_class`, plus a `pg_index`
   entry.
   
4. The indexed columns can be

   * simple columns of of the underlying table
   * expressions over the table row (or column?)
   
5. All the support functions of `IndexAmRoutine` has an argument of type 
   `Relation`, which has access to this index instance's `pg_index` entry
   
   ```c
   /* These are non-NULL only for an index relation: */
	 Form_pg_index rd_index;		/* pg_index tuple describing this index */
	 /* use "struct" here to avoid needing to include htup.h: */
	 struct HeapTupleData *rd_indextuple;	/* all of pg_index tuple */
   ```
