1. Every access method (regardless of its type) has an entry in system 
   catalog `pg_am`:
   
   ```sql
   steve=# select * from pg_am;
    oid  | amname |      amhandler       | amtype
   ------+--------+----------------------+--------
       2 | heap   | heap_tableam_handler | t
     403 | btree  | bthandler            | i
     405 | hash   | hashhandler          | i
     783 | gist   | gisthandler          | i
    2742 | gin    | ginhandler           | i
    4000 | spgist | spghandler           | i
    3580 | brin   | brinhandler          | i
   (7 rows)
   ```
   
   An entry contains:
   
   * name: the name of the AM
   * handler: a function that returns the defined  `struct IndexAmRoutine`. 
     It will takes a dummy argument of type `internal` to prevent it from 
     being accidentially called in normal SQL. The returned struct has to
     be `palloc()`'d:
     
     In Rust, it will be typically like:
     
     ```rust
     #[pg_extern(sql = "
     CREATE FUNCTION bm25_handler(internal) RETURNS index_am_handler PARALLEL SAFE IMMUTABLE STRICT COST 0.0001 LANGUAGE c AS 'MODULE_PATHNAME', '@FUNCTION_NAME@';
     CREATE ACCESS METHOD bm25 TYPE INDEX HANDLER bm25_handler;
     COMMENT ON ACCESS METHOD bm25 IS 'bm25 index access method';
     ")]
     fn bm25_handler(_fcinfo: pg_sys::FunctionCallInfo) -> PgBox<pg_sys::IndexAmRoutine> 
     ```
     
     
   * type: it is a table or an index
