1. Composite type is pretty similar to Rust tuple, which allows you to combine
   different kinds of types together.

   Different from Rust tuple, a composite type in Postgres has a name, while Rust
   tuple is anonymous.

   To create a composite type, do this:
   
   ```sql
   CREATE TYPE ComplexNumber AS (
	   real int,
	   imaginary int
   );
   ```

   Then apply it in a table:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE complex (
        n ComplexNumber,
        uuid int
   );
   ```

   Insert values to the table:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO complex
           values(ROW (1, 0), 0);
   ```

   Read the field of a composite type:

   > Note the `()`

   ```sql
   SELECT
       (n).real
   FROM
       complex;
   ```

2. Whenever you create a table in Postgres, a composite type representing the 
   table row is created:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE students (
       id int,
       name varchar(10)
   );

   SELECT
       *
   FROM
       pg_type
   WHERE
       typname LIKE 'students';
   ```

   This is the reason why there is a field `tdtypeid` in `struct TupleDescData`.

3. A composite type does not have constraints, when a composite type is automatically
   created by a table creation, the constraints on the table won't be included in the 
   type.
