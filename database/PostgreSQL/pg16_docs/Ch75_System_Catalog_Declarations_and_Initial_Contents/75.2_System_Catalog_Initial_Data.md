# 75.2.1 Data file format

> Each system catalog has an editable data file containing the original data
> (some may not), such a file is named with `pg_xxx.dat`, this section introduces
> its format.


`.dat` file is a Perl structure literal that will be evaluated into an in-memory
array of hashmap:


```perl
[

{ oid => '1', oid_symbol => 'Template1DbOid',
  descr => 'default template for new databases',
  datname => 'template1', encoding => 'ENCODING',
  datlocprovider => 'LOCALE_PROVIDER', datistemplate => 't',
  datallowconn => 't', dathasloginevt => 'f', datconnlimit => '-1',
  datfrozenxid => '0', datminmxid => '1', dattablespace => 'pg_default',
  datcollate => 'LC_COLLATE', datctype => 'LC_CTYPE', datlocale => 'DATLOCALE',
  daticurules => 'ICU_RULES', datacl => '_null_' },

]
```

1. Every map in the array represents a tuple.

2. Keys in a key-value pair refer to the column names or some metadata keys,
   while values are column values.

   Metadata keys are optional, catalog columns must be provided unless a default
   value is specified in the `pg_xxx.h` file.

3. All the values need to be single-quoted. If you want to specify a single quote
   in the value, it needs to be escaped.

4. NULL is represented by `'_null_'`

5. Comments must started with `#` and in its own line

6. Fields of type `OID` of **other catalog entries** should be represented by
   symbolic names rather than real OID values. (See the `dattablespace` field
   above)

   > QUES: why? I guess this will be used as a cross-check to ensure correctness.

   > Don't use magic numbers.
