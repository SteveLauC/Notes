Every table has several system columns that are implicitly defined by the system,
users cannot create a column that has the same name as those system columns.

```sql
steve=# SELECT
	attnum,
	attname,
	pg_type.typname
FROM
	pg_attribute
	JOIN pg_type ON pg_attribute.atttypid = pg_type.oid
WHERE
	attrelid = (
		SELECT
			oid
		FROM
			pg_class
		WHERE
			relname = 'students')
	ORDER BY
		attnum;

 attnum | attname  | typname 
--------+----------+---------
     -6 | tableoid | oid
     -5 | cmax     | cid
     -4 | xmax     | xid
     -3 | cmin     | cid
     -2 | xmin     | xid
     -1 | ctid     | tid
      1 | id       | int4
      2 | name     | varchar
(8 rows)		

steve=# select tableoid, xmin, xmax, cmin, cmax, ctid, id name from students;
 tableoid | xmin | xmax | cmin | cmax | ctid  | name 
----------+------+------+------+------+-------+------
    24576 |  737 |    0 |    0 |    0 | (0,1) |    1
    24576 |  748 |    0 |    0 |    0 | (0,2) |    2
(2 rows)

steve=# \d students;
                     Table "public.students"
 Column |         Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default 
--------+-----------------------+-----------+----------+---------
 id     | integer               |           |          | 
 name   | character varying(30) |           |          | 
```

```sql
steve=# create table test_create_system_column (tableoid oid);
ERROR:  column name "tableoid" conflicts with a system column name
```


1. `oid`

   The object identifier of a row. This column is only present if this table is
   created with `WITH OIDS`, or the `default_with_oids` configuration entry is
   set at the time.
   
   > Starting from Postgres 8.1, `WITHOUT OIDS` is the default.

2. `tableoid`
   
   The OID of the table that this tuple belongs to.
   
   Postgres doc says that this feature is useful when a query involves [`table Inheritance`][link].
   
   [link]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-inherit.html
   
   > QUES: I don't quite get this feature
   
   > Stored in `HeapTupleData.t_tableOid`
   
3. `xmin`

   The transaction ID of the transaction inserted this row.
   
   > Stored in heap header `HeapTupleFields.t_xmin`

4. `cmin`

   The command identifier (starting at zero) within the inserting transaction.
   
   > Stored in heap header `HeapTupleFields.t_field3.t_cid`

5. `xmax`
   
   The transaction ID of the transaction that deletes this row, or zero if this
   row hasn't been deleted yet.
   
   It can be non-zero for an alive tuple, which indicates that a deleting 
   transaction hasn't been committed yet, or that an attempted deletion 
   was rolled back.
   
   > Stored in heap header `HeapTupleFields.t_xmax`

6. `cmax`

   The command identifier within the deleting transaction, or zero.
   
   > QUES: command identifier can be 0, but this field is also 0 when it is not
   > deleted?
   >
   > Yes
   
   If `xmax` is set, then `cmax` is the command identifier of the delete satement
   within the transaction, or both fields should be 0.
   
   > Stored in heap header `HeapTupleFields.t_field3.t_cid`

7. `ctid`

   Unique tuple identifer (BlockIdData, OffsetNumber). This can be used to quickly
   locate a row since it directly shows the physical location, however, it will
   change after a `VACUUM FULL` command.
   
   > Stored in `HeapTupleData.t_self`
