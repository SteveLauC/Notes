> An overview about TOAST (The oversized attribute storage technique)

1. Why do we need TOAST

   Pg by default uses 8k as the page size, and dose not allow a tuple to span
   multiple pages, so it is not possible to store a field larger than 8k directly.

   To overcome this limitation, large fileds are compressed and broken up into
   multuple physical rows, this is called TOAST, it is used both in memory and
   on disk.

2. TOAST is only supported by var-len types, for fixed-length types, they 
   unlikely exceeds the 8k limit.

   Var-len types in PostgreSQL have the following representation:

   ```
   | length (4B, including this 4B) | Contents (var-len) |
   ```

   If a var-len field uses TOAST, then we say its value is TOASTed, it will
   no longer has the above format after that. The process of reverting a
   TOASTed value is called detoasting (Usually done by invoking the 
   `PG_DETOAST_DATUM()` function).
