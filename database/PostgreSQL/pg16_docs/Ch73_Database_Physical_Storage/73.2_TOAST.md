> An overview about TOAST (The oversized attribute storage technique)

1. Why do we need TOAST

   Pg by default uses 8k as the page size, and dose not allow a tuple to span
   multiple pages, so it is not possible to store a field larger than 8k directly.

   And actually, if a tuple is larger than `TOAST_TUPLE_THRESHOLD`(2KiB by default),
   then TOAST will kick in.

   To overcome this limitation, large fields are compressed and broken up into
   multiple physical rows in an associated TOAST table, this is called TOAST, 
   it is used both in memory and on disk.

   > The `OID` of the TOAST table of a table can be listed via:
   >
   > 0 means that this table does not have an associated TOAST table.
   > 
   > ```sql
   > steve> select relname, reltoastrelid from pg_catalog.pg_class limit 10
   > +---------------------+---------------+
   > | relname             | reltoastrelid |
   > |---------------------+---------------|
   > | students            | 0             |
   > | index_on_id         | 0             |

   > | pg_toast_1255       | 0             |
   > | pg_toast_1255_index | 0             |
   > | pg_toast_1247       | 0             |
   > | pg_toast_1247_index | 0             |
   > | pg_toast_2604       | 0             |
   > | pg_toast_2604_index | 0             |
   > +---------------------+---------------+

2. TOAST is only supported by var-len types, for fixed-length types, they 
   unlikely exceeds the 8k limit.

   * JSON/JSONB
   * TEXT
   * VARCHAR
   * BYTEA

   Var-len types in PostgreSQL have the following representation:

   ```
   | length (4B, including this 4B) | Contents (var-len) |
   ```

   If a var-len field uses TOAST, then we say its value is TOASTed, after this,
   the length 4 bytes will no longer be used to store length.
   
   The process of reverting a TOASTed value is called detoasting (Usually done by 
   invoking the `PG_DETOAST_DATUM()` function).

3. Format of a toasted attribute

   00: untoasted, the remaining 30 bits contain the data length.
