1. Visibility map is only available for heap pages (i.e., table file)

2. 2 bits are stored for each heap page

   1. A bit, if set, indicating that this page does not contain dead tuples (tuples
      that are deleted or updated, and thus need to be vacuumed)

   2. The second bit, if set, indicating that all tuples in this page have been
      frozen.

3. Visibility map is conservative:

   * If a bit is set, then we are sure that the condition is true
   * But if a bit is not set, the condition may or may not be true
