> This section describes the physical storage format used by PostgreSQL at the
> file and directories level.

1. `$PGDATA`

   All the data files of a PG cluster is stored in directory called `PGDATA`, 
   when initializing or start a pg database, one can specify this location
   with either `-D/--pgdata` or environment variable `PGDATA`.

2. Files under `PGDATA`

   * postgresql.conf: configuration file
     
     > It is possible to store it in other places

   * pg_hba.conf:  Client Authentication Configuration File
     
     > It is possible to store it in other places

   * pg_ident.conf: User Name Maps file (mapping external user names to pg internal 
     user names)
     
     > It is possible to store it in other places

   * PG_VERSION: a file containing major version number of this pg

   * base: the database directory, each database will have a sub-directory under
     base.

     ```sh
     $ l
     Permissions Links Size User  Group Date Modified Name
     drwx------@     1    - steve steve 20 Jun 20:12  1
     drwx------@     1    - steve steve 20 Jun 16:10  4
     drwx------@     1    - steve steve 20 Jun 20:12  5
     drwx------@     1    - steve steve 20 Jun 20:12  16388
     ```

   * current_logfiles: a file recording where the log goes

     ```sh
     $ cat current_logfiles
     stderr log/postgresql-Fri.log
     ```

     Log will be written to standard error and file `log/postgresql-Fri.log`.

   * global: a directory contains cluster-wide system databases data, like 
     `pg_database`.

   * pg_commit_ts: directory containing transaction commit timestamps.

   * pg_dynshmem: directory containing files used by shared memory system

   * pg_logical: directory containing status data for logical decoding

     > QUES: I do not understand what is status data

   * pg_multixact: directory containing multi-transaction status data (used for shared row locks)

   * pg_notify: directory containing LISTEN/NOTIFY data

   * pg_replslot: directory containing replication slot data

   * pg_serial: directory containing information about com- mitted serializable transactions 

   * pg_snapshots: directory containing exported snapshots

     > What does "exported" mean here?

   * pg_stat: directory containing files used by statistics system

   * pg_stat_temp: directory containing temporary files used by statistics system

   * pg_subtrans: directory containing sub-transaction status data 
     
     > nested transaction is supported by PostgreSQL
