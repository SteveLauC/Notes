> This section describes the physical storage format used by PostgreSQL at the
> file and directories level.

1. `$PGDATA`

   All the data files of a PG cluster is stored in directory called `PGDATA`, 
   when initializing or starting a pg database, one can specify this location
   with either `-D/--pgdata` or environment variable `PGDATA`.

2. Files under `PGDATA`

   * postgresql.conf: configuration file
     
     > It is possible to store it in other places

   * pg_hba.conf:  Client Authentication Configuration File
     
     > It is possible to store it in other places

   * pg_ident.conf: User Name Maps file (mapping external user names to pg internal 
     user names)
     
     > It is possible to store it in other places

   * PG_VERSION: a file containing major version number of this pg

   * base: the database directory, each database will have a sub-directory under
     base.

   * current_logfiles: a file recording where the log goes

     ```sh
     $ cat current_logfiles
     stderr log/postgresql-Fri.log
     ```

     Log will be written to standard error and file `log/postgresql-Fri.log`.

     `pg_database`.

   * pg_commit_ts: directory containing transaction commit timestamps.

   * pg_stat_temp: directory containing temporary files used by statistics system

   * pg_subtrans: directory containing sub-transaction status data 
     
     > nested transaction is supported by PostgreSQL

   * pg_tblspc: directory containing symlinks to tablespaces

     > QUES: what is tablespace

   * pg_wal: directory containing WAL files

   * pg_xact: directory containing trnasaction commit status data

   * postgresql.auto.conf: file containing configuration entries made by `ALTER SYSTEM`

   * postmaster.opts: file containing the cli arguments passed to the server master 
     process

     ```sh
     $ cat postmaster.opts
     /usr/bin/postgres "-D" "/home/steve/Documents/workspace/pg_playground"
     ```

   * postmaster.pid: a lock file containing

     > This file will be stopped if the server shuts down

     ```sh
     $ cat postmaster.pid
     37070
     /home/steve/Documents/workspace/pg_playground

     ```

     1. master process pid
     2. `$PGDATA`
     3. master process start timestamp
     4. The port number that the master process is listening on
     5. directory containing UNIX domain socket 
     6. first valid listen address and shared memory segment ID

3. Database files

   All the files of a database are stored under `PGDATA/base/OID` (if using the
   default tablespace).

   Table and indexes are stored in their own file, files for ordinary tables 
   and indexes are named after their `filenode`, for temporary tables, they 
   are named as `tBBB_FFF`, where `BBB` is the backend that creates this table,
   `FFF` is the `filenode`.

   > `filenode` is stored in system catalog table `pg_class`, this is kinda similar
   > to the `sqlite_master`(`sqlite_schema`) table in SQLite.

   ```sql
   > create table students (id int, name varchar(30));
   > select relname, relfielnode from pg_class;
   +------------------------------------------------+-------------+
   | relname                                        | relfilenode |
   |------------------------------------------------+-------------|
   | students                                       | 24576       |
   ```

   ```sh
   $ pwd
   /home/steve/Documents/workspace/pg_playground/base/16388

   $ l 24576
   Permissions Links Size User  Group Date Modified Name
   .rw-------@     1    0 steve steve 21 Jun 11:00  24576
   ```

   ```sql
   steve> insert into students values (1, 'steve');
   INSERT 0 1
   Time: 0.003s
   ```
   
   ```sh
   $ l 24576
   Permissions Links Size User  Group Date Modified Name
   .rw-------@     1 8.2k steve steve 21 Jun 11:03  24576
   ``` 

   Apart the main file (also called main fork) described above, each table and 
   index (non-hash index) also has a free space map, stores information about 
   available space in the main file, it is named `filenode_fsm`.

   Tables also have a visibility map to track pages that have no dead tuples(tuples
   that have been removed, will be cleared in `vacuum` (compaction in LSM), stored
   in file `filenode_vm`.

   Unlogged (no WAL!) table and index have a third fork, known as the 
   initialization fork, named after  `filenode_init`
   

   > NOTE:
   >
   > It is quite common that the `oid` of a table matches its `filenode`, but 
   > it is not necessarily the case.
   >
   > ```
   > steve> select oid, relname, relfilenode from pg_class where relname = 'students'
   > +-------+----------+-------------+
   > | oid   | relname  | relfilenode |
   > |-------+----------+-------------|
   > | 24576 | students | 24576       |
   > +-------+----------+-------------+
   > ```

4. Some tables' `relfilenode`s are 0, 0 is just an indicator indicating that the
   real `relfilenode` is stored in a low level data structure, and can be obtained 
   by table function `pg_relation_filenode()`

   > QUES: what tables will have filenode 0?


   ```sh
   steve> select * from pg_relation_filenode('pg_type');
   +----------------------+
   | pg_relation_filenode |
   |----------------------|
   | 1247                 |
   +----------------------+

   steve> select relfilenode, relname from pg_class where relfilenode = 0 limit 10;
   +-------------+---------------------+
   | relfilenode | relname             |
   |-------------+---------------------|
   | 0           | pg_type             |
   | 0           | pg_toast_1255       |
   | 0           | pg_toast_1255_index |
   | 0           | pg_toast_1247       |
   | 0           | pg_toast_1247_index |
   | 0           | pg_toast_1262       |
   | 0           | pg_toast_1262_index |
   | 0           | pg_toast_2964       |
   | 0           | pg_toast_2964_index |
   | 0           | pg_toast_1213       |
   +-------------+---------------------+
   ```

   Function `pg_relation_filepath()` returns the relative path (relative to `PGDATA`)
   of **the first main fork** of a relation:

   > It won't show other forks, fsm, vm, and main fork can span multiple files.

   ```sql
   steve> select * from pg_relation_filepath('public.students');
   +----------------------+
   | pg_relation_filepath |
   |----------------------|
   | base/16388/24576     |
   +----------------------+
   ```

5. By default, when a table file (fork)'s exceeds 1 GiB, it will be split to 
   multiple segments, each segment will be 1 GiB at most.

   > This is because when the page size is 8192, the maximum file size is 1 GiB,
   > controlled by page size `BLCKSZ` 8192 and `RELSEG_SIZE` 131072
   >
   > 8192 * 131072 = 1073741824 = 1 GiB
   >
   > Postgres limits file size to 1 GiB because they don't want to exceed the
   > OS limit, on 32-bit OSes, the file size limit is usually 2 GiB or 4 GiB.

   This limit value can be adjusted during compilation with `--with-segsize`.

   Other forks like free space map and visibility also have this limit, but 
   this probably won't happen in practice.
