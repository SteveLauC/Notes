1. The default page size is 8Kb, you cannot change it unless you re-compile it
   from the source code.

   [How to change/set the block size in Postgres? Is there any file to make the configuration?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/56147727/14092446)


3. In Postgres, all the heap pages are logically equivalent, so a tuple can be
   stored in any page (heap file organization). SQLite is different, it uses a
   B-Tree to organize pages, though they all use slotted pages.

   For index pages, the first page is generally reserved as a meta page holding 
   control information. And there can be different kinds of pages within the
   index, depending on the index access method.

4. Overall Page Layout

   > For table: heap file organization and slotted pages
   >
   > For B-tree index: (I guess) B+Tree and slotted pages

   | Item | Description| 
   |------|------------|
   |PageHeaderData | 24 bytes long, contains general infornation about the page, including 2 free space pointers|
   |ItemIdData | Array of item identifiers pointing to the actual items, each entry is an (offset, len) pair (fat ptr), 4 bytes per item |
   |FreeSpace | The unallocated space, new ItemID will be allocated from the start, item from the end |
   |Items | The actual items (tuples) |
   |Special space | Index method specific data, empty for table pages (B+Tree index stores left and right sibling ptrs) |

5. PageHeaderLayout

   > src: `src/include/storage/bufpage.h`

   | Field | Type | Len | Description |
   |-------|------|-----|-------------|
   | pd_lsn | PageXLogRecPtr | 8 bytes | LSN: next byte after last byte of WAL record for last (latest) change to this page |
   | pd_checksum | uint16 | 2 bytes | Page checksum if `data checksums` are enabled (`SHOW data_checksum`) or it will all 0s (src: `src/include/storage/checksum_impl.h` ) |
   | pd_flags | uint16 | 2 bytes | flag bits |
   | pd_lower | LocationIndex (alias to uint16) | 2 bytes | offset to start of free space |
   | pd_upper | LocationIndex (alias to uint16) | 2 bytes | offset to end of free space |
   | pd_special | LocationIndex (alias to uint16) | 2 bytes | offset to start of special space (8192 if this is a table page, i.e, no special space) |
   | pd_page_size_version | uint16 | 2 bytes | Page size and layout version number (On a little endian machine, the first byte is the page version, the second byte is page size (serves as a crosscheck, variable page size is not supported), starting from Pg 8.3, page version is 4) |
   | pd_prune_xid | TransactionId (alias to uint32) | 4 bytes | Oldest unpruned XMAX on page, or zero if none |

   The `pd_page_size` field is simply for check purpose, PostgreSQL does not 
   support having different page sizes for different tables, and to change the
   page size, one have to rebuild the binary.

6. Encoding of the `PageXLogRecPtr` type

   ```c
   /*
   * For historical reasons, the 64-bit LSN value is stored as two 32-bit
   * values.
   */
   typedef struct
   {
      uint32		xlogid;			/* high bits */
      uint32		xrecoff;		/* low bits */
   } PageXLogRecPtr;
   ```

   ```
   | wal file ID (32 bits) | segment number (8bits) | block number (13bits) |offset within the block (11bits) |
   ```

7. The number of `ItemIdData` allocated can be calculated with

   $$ (pd\_lower - 12) /4 $$

8. The field `ctid`, is the number of `(page ID, idx of ItemID)`. An `ItemIdData`
   will not be moved until it is freed, so `ctid` can be seen as a long-term 
   reference to a tuple.

   Even though a tuple data is moved within a page, its `ItemIdData` won't be 
   moved.

9. Tuple layout

   * fixed-size header
   * Optional NULL bitmap 

     1. It is Some if the `HEAP_HASNULL` bit is set in `t_infomask` in header
     2. Every field will occupy 1 bit, and the total size will be rounded up to
        whole bytes, i.e., 5 bits -> 1 byte.
        If the bit is set, then this field is non-null.
     3. If this field is None, then all the fields are non-null.

   * Optional Object ID

     This ID is only present if the `HEAP_HASOID_OLD` bit is set in `t_infomask`. 
     If present, it appears just before the `t_hoff` boundary.

   * tuple data (start offset stored in header `t_hoff`)

     The tuple data must be aligned with `MAXALIGN`, the padding needed by this
     alignment is stored between optional NULL bitmap and optional Object ID.

     To interrupt the tuple data, one has to read the data from other tables, 
     mostly `pg_attribute`.

10. Tuple header

    |name    | type               | length | Description      | 
    |--------|--------------------|--------|------------------|
    | t_xmin | TransactionId(u32) | 4B     | insert XID stamp |
    | t_xmax | TransactionId(u32) | 4B     | delete XID stamp |
    | t_cid  | CommandId(u32)     | 4B     | insert or delete CID stamp (overlays with t_xvac) |
    | t_xvac | TransactionId(u32) | 4B     | XID for VACUUM operation moving a row version |
    | t_ctid | ItemPointerData(struct) | 6B     | XID for VACUUM operation moving a row version |
    | t_infomask2 | uint16 | 2B     | number of attributes, plus various bitflags |
    | t_infomask | uint16 | 2B     | plus various bitflags |
    | t_hoff | uint8 | 1B     | offset to user data |
