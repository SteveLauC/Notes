1. The default page size is 8Kb, you cannot change it unless you re-compile it
   from the source code.

   [How to change/set the block size in Postgres? Is there any file to make the configuration?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/56147727/14092446)

2. For indexes, the first page is generally reserved as a metapage holding 
   control information.

3. Overall Page Layout

   > For table: heap file organization and slotted pages
   >
   > For B-tree index: (I guess) B+Tree and slotted pages

   | Item | Description| 
   |------|------------|
   |PageHeader | 24 bytes long, contains general infornation about the page, including 2 free space pointers|
   |ItemID | Array of item identifiers pointing to the actual items, each entry is an (offset, len) pair, 4 bytes per item |
   |FreeSpace | The unallocated space, new ItemID will be allocated from the start, item from the end |
   |Items | The actual items (tuples) |
   |Special space | Index method specific data, empty for table pages |

4. PageHeaderLayout

   | Field | Type | Len | Description |
   |-------|------|-----|-------------|
   | pd_lsn | PageXLogRecPtr | 8 bytes | LSN: next byte after last byte of WAL record for last (latest) change to this page |
   | pd_checksum | uint16 | 2 bytes | Page chechsum if `data checksums` are enabled |
   | pd_flags | uint16 | 2 bytes | flag bits |
   | pd_lower | LocationIndex | 2 bytes | offset to start of free space |
   | pd_upper | LocationIndex | 2 bytes | offset to end of free space |
   | pd_special | LocationIndex | 2 bytes | offset to start of special space |
   | pd_page_size_version | uint16 | 2 bytes | Page size and layout version number |
   | pd_prune_xid | TransactionId | 4 bytes | Oldest unpruned XMAX on page, or zero if none |

   The `pd_page_size` field is simply for check purpose, PostgreSQL does not 
   support having different page sizes for different tables, and to change the
   page size, one have to rebuild the binary.

5. The field `ctid`, is the number of `(page ID, idx of ItemID)`.

6. Tuple layout

   * header
   * NULL bitmap
   * tuple data
