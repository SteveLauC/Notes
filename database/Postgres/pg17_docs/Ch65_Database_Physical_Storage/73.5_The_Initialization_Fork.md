For tables with WAL enabled, when crash happens, we redo the logs stored in WAL
and rebuild the table.

With unlogged table, we simply replace the main fork with its initialization fork,
an initialization fork is an **empty** table with the same type as the unlogged 
table.

Other forks will be rebuilt when needed.
