1. When Postgres thinks a query can be run in parallel, it creates a `Gather` or 
   `Gather Merge` node in the plan.  the operations below this node will be run
   in parallel by the chosen workers as well as the leader (the backend process)

2. When the parallel portion only generates a small number of tuples, the leader
   process will behave just like a worker, i.e., execute the parallel plan.  

   Otherwise, the leader may be almost entirely occupied with reading the tuples 
   generated by the workers and performing any further processing steps that are 
   required by plan nodes above the level of the Gather node or Gather Merge node.

3. Diff between `Gather` and `Gather Merge`

   `Gater Merge` means the parallel part of the plan will emit ordered tuples, which
   the leader need to merge and preserve the order.
