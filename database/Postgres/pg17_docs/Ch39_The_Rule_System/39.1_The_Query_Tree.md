# Components of a Query tree (struct Query)

* range table: a list of relations used in the query.  For `SELECT`, these are 
  relations after the `FROM` keyword.

* result relation: the table to which the query result will go. Identified by
  the index number in the range table list. 0 for `SELECT` statements.
  
* target list: a list of expr that define the query result
  
  * For SELECT: projection, `*` is a special abbreviation that will be expaned
    by the analyzer.
    
    ```c
    /*
     * transformTargetList()
     * Turns a list of ResTarget's into a list of TargetEntry's.
     *
     * This code acts mostly the same for SELECT, UPDATE, or RETURNING lists;
     * the main thing is to transform the given expressions (the "val" fields).
     * The exprKind parameter distinguishes these cases when necessary.
     */
    List *
    transformTargetList(ParseState *pstate, List *targetlist,
					ParseExprKind exprKind)
    ```
    
  * INSERT 
  * DELETE
  * UPDATE
  
* join tree: `FROM` and `WHERE` clause

  > QUES: range table also contains data from the `FROM` clause, any difference
  > between these 2?
