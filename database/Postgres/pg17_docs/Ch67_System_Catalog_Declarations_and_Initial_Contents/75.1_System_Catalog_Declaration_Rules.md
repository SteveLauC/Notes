> How is a system catalog table defined in its `src/include/catalog/pg_xxx.h` file.

1. System catalog tables are defined using a C struct started with `CATALOG`, 
   the fields defined in this struct are the columns in the relation.

   Special macro defined in `src/include/catalog/genbki.h` can be used to add
   attributes to a column (see the `BKI_DEFAULT` macro below):

   ```c
   CATALOG(pg_class,1259,RelationRelationId) BKI_BOOTSTRAP BKI_ROWTYPE_OID(83,RelationRelation_Rowtype_Id) BKI_SCHEMA_MACRO
   {
        /* oid */
        Oid			oid;

        /* class name */
        NameData	relname;

        /* OID of namespace containing this class */
        Oid			relnamespace BKI_DEFAULT(pg_catalog) BKI_LOOKUP(pg_namespace);
    ```

2. Fixed-size field are assumed to be non-null. Var-len and nullable fields are 
   placed at the end.

   > the documentation, in my understanding, this is simply for convenience.


3. Null-able or var-len fields are not exposed to the C compiler, they are gated
   with the `#ifdef CATALOG_VARLEN/#endif` macro, which will never be defined.

   ```c
   #ifdef CATALOG_VARLEN			/* variable-length fields start here */
       /* NOTE: These fields are not present in a relcache entry's rd_rel field. */
       /* access permissions */
       aclitem		relacl[1] BKI_DEFAULT(_null_);

       /* access-method-specific options */
       text		reloptions[1] BKI_DEFAULT(_null_);

       /* partition bound node tree */
       pg_node_tree relpartbound BKI_DEFAULT(_null_);
   #endif
   } FormData_pg_class;
   ```

4. Bootstrap catalogs

   Some catalogs are so fundamental that they are relied by the BKI script, such 
   catalogs have to be created manually.
