NOTE: Well, I think by "Index Methods", the documentation means "Index Access Methods".

# 36.16.1. Index Methods and Operator Classes

1. What is Operator Class

   An operator class contains:
   
   * several operators
   * support functions(QUES: what is this for?)
   
  When you create an index (`index`) for a column (`datatype`), an operator class
  can be specified:
  
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX foo ON table using ivfflat (embedding vector_ops);
  ```
  
  Once an operator class is linked to a `(datatype/column, index)` pair, it let's
  the planner (or optimizer) know that for all the operators defined in the 
  operator class, we can use the index.
  
2. Default operator class for a `(datatype, index)`

   QUES(Solved): How to specify the default operator class?
   
   
   Use the `[ DEFAULT ]` keyword
   
   ```sql
   CREATE OPERATOR CLASS name [ DEFAULT ] FOR TYPE data_type
   ```
   
3. Multiple operator classes can be specified for the same `(datatype, index)`

   QUES: which one will be used by the planner?
