# 36.10.1. Dynamic Loading  

1. The first time a C function gets called/invoked, Postgres/dynamic loader 
   loads the shared object file that contains this function to the memory.

   In order to make this work, extension developers have to provide 2 arguments
   when writing `CREATE FUNCTION` in the extension SQL script:

   1. Path to the shared object that contains the function
 
      It can be:

      * an absolute path 
      * Path under `$libdir`, e.g., `$libdir/heap_tuple_summary`, Postgres will 
        replace `$libdir` with `$(pg_config --pkglibdir)`.

        > Shoot, this is so confusing. `libdir` and `pkglibdir` are 2 different
        > locations.
        >
        > https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/Pine.LNX.4.56.0307310942260.1729%40krusty.credativ.de
        
      * If the name does not contain a directory part, the file is searched for 
        in the path specified by the configuration variable `dynamic_library_path`.

        > `dynamic_library_path` is a configuration entry in `postgres.conf`

      If the above lookup procedure fails, Postgres will append a `.so` (`.dylib` on 
      macOS) extension to the `obj_file`, then search for it again.

   2. Name of C function, which is optional, SQL function name will be used 
      instead if it is not supplied.

      Thus, if your C function and SQL function have the same name, you can omit
      this parameter.

   > From doc of `CREATE FUNCTION`:
   >
   > https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html
   > 
   >  # obj_file, link_symbol
   >
   > This form of the `AS` clause is used for dynamically loadable C language 
   > functions when the function name in the C language source code is not the 
   > same as the name of the SQL function. The string `obj_file` is the name of 
   > the shared library file containing the compiled C function, and is interpreted 
   > as for the [LOAD](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-load.html) command. 
   >
   > The string `link_symbol` is the function's link symbol, that is, the name 
   > of the function in the C language source code. If the link symbol is omitted, 
   > it is assumed to be the same as the name of the SQL function being defined. 
   > The C names of all functions must be different, so you must give overloaded C 
   > functions different C names (for example, use the argument types as part of 
   > the C names).
   >
   > When repeated `CREATE FUNCTION` calls refer to the same object file, the file 
   > is only loaded once per session. To unload and reload the file (perhaps 
   > during development), start a new session.

2. "magic block" to prevent incompatibility

   To ensure that a dynamically loaded object file is not loaded into an 
   incompatible server, PostgreSQL checks that the file contains a 
   “magic block” with the appropriate contents. This allows the server to 
   detect obvious incompatibilities, such as code compiled for a different 
   major version of PostgreSQL. To include a magic block, write this in 
   one (and only one) of the module source files, after having included the 
   header `fmgr.h`:

   ```c
   PG_MODULE_MAGIC;
   ```

3. There is currently no way to unload a loaded shared object unless you re-open a
   new session.
   
   > "session" means a `psql` connection, i.e., a connetion to the backend 
   > `postgres` process, its lifetime.

4. Every dynamic shared object can have an init function:

   ```c
   void _PG_init(void) {
       /* impl here */
   }
   ```

   It will be called immediately when the object file gets loaded


# 36.10.2. Base Types in C-Language Functions 

1. There are 3 kinds of types:

   1. pass by value, fixed-length
   
      The maximum size of this kind of type is the pointer size.
   
   2. pass by reference, fixed-length
   
      ```c
      /* 16-byte structure, passed by reference */
      typedef struct
      {
          double  x, y;
      } PointData;
      
      typedef PointData * Pointer;
      ```
   
   3. pass by reference, variable-length
   
      It is required that the first 4 bytes (first field, C compiler won't 
      reorder fields) should be the **total** length of  this variable type 
      (including the 4 bytes). For example, here is how the `Vector` type 
      is defined in `pgvector`:
   
      ```c
      typedef struct Vector
      {
       	int32		vl_len_;		/* varlena header (do not touch directly!) */
       	int16		dim;			/* number of dimensions */
       	int16		unused;			/* reserved for future use, always zero */
       	float		x[FLEXIBLE_ARRAY_MEMBER];
      }	Vector;
      ```
      
      These 4 bytes should not be modified manually, we should always set it via
      the `SET_VARSIZE(pointer_to_struct, size)` macro.
      
      There is a constant `VARHDRSZ` to represent the varlen header size.
      

2. PostgreSQL SQL Type to C Type Mapping, and their types

   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | `boolean` | `bool` | `postgres.h` (or compiler built-in) | fixed-size, pass by value |

   | `varchar` | `VarChar*` | `postgres.h` |var-len, ref |
   | `xid` | `TransactionId` | `postgres.h` | fixed-size, value |
   

# 36.10.3. Version 1 Calling Conventions 

> This is currently the only calling convention that Postgres has

1. Function signature

   Public (by pub, I mean it will be exposed and loaded by Postgres) C functions 
   should be declared in this way if you follow this convention:
   
   ```c
   Datum your_func(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS);
   ```
   
   And you should write this macro `PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(your_func);` right above 
   this funtion, so:
   
   
   ```c
   PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(your_func);
   Datum your_func(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS) {
       /* impl */
   }
   ```
   
   Real-world example:
   
   ```c
   PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(add_one);
   Datum
   add_one(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
   {
       int32   arg = PG_GETARG_INT32(0);
   
       PG_RETURN_INT32(arg + 1);
   }
   ```
   
   What does that `PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1` macro do?
   
   ```c 
   /*
    *	Macro to build an info function associated with the given function name.
    *
    *	As a convenience, also provide an "extern" declaration for the given
    *	function name, so that writers of C functions need not write that too.
    *
    *	On Windows, the function and info function must be exported.  Our normal
    *	build processes take care of that via .DEF files or --export-all-symbols.
    *	Module authors using a different build process might need to manually
    *	declare the function PGDLLEXPORT.  We do that automatically here for the
    *	info function, since authors shouldn't need to be explicitly aware of it.
    */
   #define PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(funcname) \
   
   // Comment by steve: This declares our C function
   extern PGDLLEXPORT Datum funcname(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS); \
   
   // Comment by steve: This declares a function called `pg_finfo_<our function>`
   extern PGDLLEXPORT const Pg_finfo_record * CppConcat(pg_finfo_,funcname)(void); \
   
   // Comment by steve: This defines the `pg_finfo_<our function>` function, which
   // tells the calling concontion version of our function
   const Pg_finfo_record * \
   CppConcat(pg_finfo_,funcname) (void) \
   { \
    	static const Pg_finfo_record my_finfo = { 1 }; \
    	return &my_finfo; \
   } \
   
   // Comment by steve: A clever little trick to enforce that you won't miss the 
   // tailing semicolon after `PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(<our function>);`. This line 
   // doesn't do anything meaningful on its own, but it's not a complete statement. 
   // 
   // If you forget the semicolon after PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(...), this dangling 
   // declaration will cause the compiler to complain about a syntax error, reminding 
   // you to add the semicolon.
   extern int no_such_variable
   ```
   
2. Extract arguments 

   You can extract the arguments using any following macros. Be sure that the argument
   is NOT null, then invoke the macro. You can check this using `PG_ARGISNULL()`. 
   Or this can be omitted if the function is declared as `STRICT` (NULL input 
   results in NULL output, Postgres handles  this for you automatically).

   * `PG_GETARG_<type>(arg_idx_num)`

   * `PG_GETARG_<type>_COPY(arg_idx_num)`
  
      This would return a copy of the argument so that you can safely write to it. 
      
      Other macros will sometimes return a pointer to a value that is physically 
      stored in a table (memory buffer), which must not be written to.
      
   * `PG_GETARG_xxx_SLICE(arg_idx_num, offset, length)` 
   
     Only ask for the data specified by `[offset, offset+length)`.
     
     `length` can be negative, any negative value means asking for all the 
     remaining bytes starting from `offset`.
   
3. To return a value
   
   And the return value should be returned using `PG_RETURN_<type>()`. To return 
   NULL, use `PG_RETURN_NULL()`.
   
4. The C macro `PG_FUNCTION_ARGS` is defined as follows:

   ```c
   /* Standard parameter list for fmgr-compatible functions */
   #define PG_FUNCTION_ARGS	FunctionCallInfo fcinfo
   ```

   So Postgres provides you a `fcinofo` variable within the functions using 
   its convention, you can directly use it:
   
   ```c
   PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(foo);
   Datum 
   foo(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS) 
   {
       printf("We have $sd arguments", fcinfo -> nargs);
       
       /* the rest of code */
   }
   ```
   
5. SQL supports function overloading:

   ```sql
   CREATE FUNCTION add_one(integer) RETURNS integer
       AS 'DIRECTORY/funcs', 'add_one'
       LANGUAGE C STRICT;
   
   -- note overloading of SQL function name "add_one"
   CREATE FUNCTION add_one(double precision) RETURNS double precision
       AS 'DIRECTORY/funcs', 'add_one_float8'
       LANGUAGE C STRICT;
   ```
   
   >  See section "36.10.9. Polymorphic Arguments and Return Types" as well.
   
# 36.10.4. Writing Code
   
1. > Always zero the bytes of your structures using memset (or allocate them 
   with palloc0 in the first place). Even if you assign to each field of your 
   structure, there might be alignment padding (holes in the structure) that 
   contain garbage values. Without this, it's difficult to support hash indexes 
   or hash joins, as you must pick out only the significant bits of your data 
   structure to compute a hash. The planner also sometimes relies on comparing 
   constants via bitwise equality, so you can get undesirable planning results 
   if logically-equivalent values aren't bitwise equal.
   
   
   TIL that Rust won't not zero padding as well!
   
# 36.10.6. Composite-Type Arguments


> In case you forget what composite types are, here is an example:
>
> ```sql
> CREATE TYPE complex AS (
>    r       double precision,
>    i       double precision
> );
> ```

1. Postgres automatically creates a composite type for every table:

   ```sql
   steve=# select typname from pg_type where typname = 'foo';
    typname
   ---------
   (0 rows)
    
   steve=# create table foo (id int);
   CREATE TABLE
   
   steve=# select typname from pg_type where typname = 'foo';
    typname
   ---------
     foo
   (1 row)
   ```

2. When you use a table name (or a table's alias) as an argument to a function, 
   you are not passing a string or a pointer. You are passing the **entire row** 
   as a single, structured value. 
   
   ```sql
   SELECT my_func(t) FROM t;
   ```
   
3. If you function takes a composite type, treat it like a row and use 
   `PG_GETARG_HEAPTUPLEHEADER()` to extract it. Here is an example:
   
   ```sql
   -- pg_ext/pg_ext--0.1.0.sql
   
   CREATE TYPE foo AS (
       a INT4,
       b INT4
   );
   
   CREATE FUNCTION format_foo(foo) RETURNS text
   AS '$libdir/pg_ext'
   LANGUAGE C STRICT;
   ```
   
   ```c
   /* pg_ext.c */
   
   #include "postgres.h"
   
   #include "fmgr.h"
   #include "access/htup.h"
   #include "executor/executor.h"
   #include <ctype.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <assert.h>
   #include "utils/builtins.h"
   
   PG_MODULE_MAGIC;
   
   #define BUF_SIZE 100
   
   PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(format_foo);
   Datum format_foo(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS) {
       /* The first argument to this function is a composite type, we extract it using `PG_GETARG_HEAPTUPLEHEADER()` */
       HeapTupleHeader heap_tuple_header = PG_GETARG_HEAPTUPLEHEADER(0);
       bool a_is_null;
       bool b_is_null;
       int32 a;
       int32 b;
       char * format_buf;
       text * ret;
       
       a = DatumGetInt32(GetAttributeByName(heap_tuple_header, "a", &a_is_null));
       b = DatumGetInt32(GetAttributeByName(heap_tuple_header, "b", &b_is_null));
       /* To simplify the impl */
       assert(a_is_null == false);
       assert(b_is_null == false);
       
       format_buf = palloc(BUF_SIZE);
       snprintf(format_buf, BUF_SIZE, "%d, %d", a, b);
       /* CString is not a Postgres type, `text *` is */
       ret = cstring_to_text(format_buf);
       /* cstring_to_text would palloc its own buffer, so we need to free our `format_buf` */ 
       //
       // Update: Postgres allocates a transient MemoryContext for every C 
       // function, which will be dropped when the invocation ends, so you don't need to
       // manually pfree() the memory.
       pfree(format_buf);
       
       PG_RETURN_TEXT_P(ret);
   }
   ```
   
   ```makefile
   MODULES = pg_ext
   EXTENSION = pg_ext
   DATA = pg_ext--0.1.0.sql
   
   PG_CONFIG = pg_config
   PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
   include $(PGXS)
   ```

# 36.10.7. Returning a Row (Composite Type)

> For how to return multiple rows, see the next section.

Construct a `TupleDesc` using the `get_cal_return_type()` function:

> the `fcinfo` argument is set by the `PG_FUNCTION_ARGS` macro:
>
> ```c
> /* Standard parameter list for fmgr-compatible functions */
> #define PG_FUNCTION_ARGS	FunctionCallInfo fcinfo
> ```

```c
TupleDesc tuple_desc = NULL;

if (get_call_result_type(fcinfo, NULL, &tuple_desc) != TYPEFUNC_COMPOSITE) {
    ereport(ERROR, errmsg("function returning record called in context that cannot accept type record”"));
}
```

Then we need to provide the data of the row, data can be supplied in 2 ways:

1. An array of `Datum` (and an array of bool values indicating if the fields are NULL)

   ```c
   tuple_desc = BlessTupleDesc(tuple_desc);
   
   Datum values[2];
   bool is_nulls[2] = { false, false };
   values[0] = Int32GetDatum(1);
   values[1] = Int32GetDatum(2);
   ```
   
2. An array of cstring (set NULL fields to NULL pointers)

   ```c
   AttInMetadata * attinmeta = TupleDescGetAttInMetadata(tupdesc);
   char ** values = { "1", "2" };
   ```
   

Then construct `HeapTuple` 

1. If you use Datum

   ```c
   HeapTuple tuple = heap_form_tuple(tuple_desc, values, is_nulls);
   ```
   
2. If you use cstring

   ```c
   HeapTuple tuple = BuildTupleFromCStrings(attinmeta, values);
   ```

Return the row:

```c
PG_RETURN_HEAPTUPLEHEADER(tuple->t_data);
```

Here is the complete implementation:

```c
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#include "postgres.h"

#include "fmgr.h"
#include "access/htup.h"
#include "access/tupdesc.h"
#include "executor/executor.h"
#include "utils/builtins.h"
#include "funcapi.h"
#include "utils/elog.h"

PG_MODULE_MAGIC;


PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(return_composite);
Datum
return_composite(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    TupleDesc tuple_desc = NULL;
    HeapTuple       tuple;
    
    if (get_call_result_type(fcinfo, NULL, &tuple_desc) != TYPEFUNC_COMPOSITE) {
        ereport(ERROR, errmsg("function returning record called in context that cannot accept type record”"));
    }
    
    Datum values[2];
    bool is_nulls[2] = { false, false };
    tuple_desc = BlessTupleDesc(tuple_desc);
    values[0] = Int32GetDatum(1);
    values[1] = Int32GetDatum(2);
    tuple = heap_form_tuple(tuple_desc, values, is_nulls);
    
    /*
     *  If you want to work with `cstring`s
     *  
     *  char ** values = { "1", "2" };
     *  AttInMetadata * attinmeta = TupleDescGetAttInMetadata(tupdesc);
     *  tuple = BuildTupleFromCStrings(attinmeta, values);
     */
    
    PG_RETURN_HEAPTUPLEHEADER(tuple->t_data);
}
```

# 36.10.8. Returning Sets (multiple rows)

1. There are 2 modes to return multiple rows in C functions:
   
   1. ValuePerCall mode
   
      > I would call this **iterator** mode
   
      The set-returing function (SRF) returns 1 row per function call, just like 
      `Iterator::next()`, when it yields all the values, return `DONE`.
        
      NOTE that when using this mode, the iterator could not yield all the values
      due to the use of `LIMIT`:
        
      ```sql
      select * from your_func_return_10_rows() limit 1;
      ```
        
      If you do resource cleanup ONLY in the last SRF call, this cleanup procedure
      could never happen. For such cases, it is recommended to use the Materialize
      mode.
   
   2. Materialize mode
   
      All the rows will be returned together in 1 set-returing call.
   
   > This is similar to how database execution works:
   >
   > 1. Pipelining (Iterator model/volcano model)
   > 2. Materialization
    
2. Where to store your iterator cursor state when using the ValuePerCall 
   mode: `FuncCallContext`
   
   ```c
   /*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *		Support struct to ease writing Set Returning Functions (SRFs)
   *-------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * This struct holds function context for Set Returning Functions.
   * Use fn_extra to hold a pointer to it across calls
   */
   typedef struct FuncCallContext
   {
    	/*
    	 * Number of times we've been called before
    	 *
    	 * call_cntr is initialized to 0 for you by SRF_FIRSTCALL_INIT(), and

    	uint64		call_cntr;
    
    	/*
    	 * OPTIONAL maximum number of calls

   Helper macro `SRF_FIRSTCALL_INIT()` will allocate `FuncCallContext` and store
   the pointer here `fcinfo -> flinof -> fn_extra`, then it returns the pointer
   to you so that you can assign it to your local variable.
   
   ```c
   typedef struct FunctionCallInfoBaseData
   {
	   FmgrInfo   *flinfo;			/* ptr to lookup info used for this call */
				
   typedef struct FmgrInfo
   {
    PGFunction	fn_addr;		/* pointer to function or handler to be called */
   	Oid			fn_oid;			/* OID of function (NOT of handler, if any) */
   	short		fn_nargs;		/* number of input args (0..FUNC_MAX_ARGS) */
   	bool		fn_strict;		/* function is "strict" (NULL in => NULL out) */
   	bool		fn_retset;		/* function returns a set */
   	unsigned char fn_stats;		/* collect stats if track_functions > this */
   	void	   *fn_extra;		/* extra space for use by handler */
   ```
   
3. Postgres provides various macros to implement set-returning functions using 
   the ValuePerCall mode, here is an example that implements `sequence(n)`, a
   function that prints `[0, n)`:
   
   ```c
   #include <ctype.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   
   #include "postgres.h"
   
   #include "fmgr.h"
   #include "access/htup.h"
   #include "access/tupdesc.h"
   #include "executor/executor.h"
   #include "utils/builtins.h"
   #include "funcapi.h"
   #include "utils/elog.h"
   
   PG_MODULE_MAGIC;
   
   
   PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(sequence);
   Datum
   sequence(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
   {
       int32 n; /* intput argument */
       Datum ret; /* return value */
       int32 call_count; /* how many numbers has this function been called */
       FuncCallContext * func_call_ctx; /* SRF call context */
       
       
       n = PG_GETARG_INT32(0);
       
       /* Use this to check if it is the first invocation of this function  */
       if (SRF_IS_FIRSTCALL()) {
           /* We need to init the FuncCallContext on first call */
           func_call_ctx = SRF_FIRSTCALL_INIT();
       }
       
       /* Set up the FuncCallContext, needed for every time, no idea why */
       func_call_ctx = SRF_PERCALL_SETUP();
       
       call_count = (int32)func_call_ctx -> call_cntr;
       
       if (call_count < n) {
           ret = Int32GetDatum(call_count);
           
           /* Return Some(ret) */
           SRF_RETURN_NEXT(func_call_ctx, ret);
           
           /* There is also a SRF_RETURN_NEXT_NULL(func_call_ctx) that yields a NULL in this iteration */
       } else {
           /* Return None */
           SRF_RETURN_DONE(func_call_ctx);
       }
   }
   ```
   
   ```sql
   -- NOTE that the return value has been changed to `SETOF INT4`
   CREATE FUNCTION sequence(INT4) RETURNS SETOF INT4
   AS '$libdir/pg_ext'
   LANGUAGE C STRICT;
   ```
   
4. Postgres creates a transient `MemoryContext` for every function call.

   SRF would be called multiple times, this rule applies as well. So, if your
   state needs to be preseved across multiple SRF calls, you use use a long-lived 
   `MemoryContext` `multi_call_memory_ctx`.
   
   ```c
   typedef struct FuncCallContext
   {
        /* Other fields are omitted */
        
    	/*
    	 * memory context used for structures that must live for multiple calls
    	 *
    	 * multi_call_memory_ctx is set by SRF_FIRSTCALL_INIT() for you, and used
    	 * by SRF_RETURN_DONE() for cleanup. It is the most appropriate memory
    	 * context for any memory that is to be reused across multiple calls of
    	 * the SRF.
    	 */
    	MemoryContext multi_call_memory_ctx;
    
   } FuncCallContext;  
   ```
    
   To do so, before allocating anything that needs to be long-lived, switch to 
   this `multi_call_memory_ctx`. Typically, when writing SRF, you state needs
   to be allocated in the first call, so you would switch to this memory context
   in the first call.
   
   ```c
   MemoryContext * old_context = MemoryContextSwitchTo(func_call_ctx -> multi_call_memory_ctx);
   ```
   
   The long-lived memory context will go away when all the SRF calls end.
   
5. Your long-lived state ('s pointer) should be stored in `FuncCallContext.user_fctx`
   
   ```c
   typedef struct FuncCallContext
   {
    	/*
    	 * OPTIONAL pointer to miscellaneous user-provided context information
    	 *
    	 * user_fctx is for use as a pointer to your own struct to retain
    	 * arbitrary context information between calls of your function.
    	 */
    	void	   *user_fctx;
   } FuncCallContext;
   ```
   
   So, here is an updated version of the `sequence(INT4)` implementation that 
   demostrates this, instead of relying on `func_call_ctx -> call_cntr`, we now
   store the invocation count in our own `State`:
   
   ```c
   #include <ctype.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   
   #include "postgres.h"
   
   #include "fmgr.h"
   #include "funcapi.h"
   
   PG_MODULE_MAGIC;
   
   /*
   * Our custom state that should survive multiple SNF calls.
   */
   typedef struct {
       /* How many types our SNF has been invoked */
       int32 snf_call_count;
   } State;
   
   
   PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(sequence);
   Datum
   sequence(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
   {
       int32 n; /* intput argument */
       Datum ret; /* return value */
       int32 * call_count_p; 
       FuncCallContext * func_call_ctx; /* SRF call context */
       State * state;
       
       n = PG_GETARG_INT32(0);
       
       if (SRF_IS_FIRSTCALL()) {
           func_call_ctx = SRF_FIRSTCALL_INIT();
           /* Switch to the context that would survive multiple calls */
           MemoryContextSwitchTo(func_call_ctx->multi_call_memory_ctx);
   
           /* Then store our state there */
           state = palloc0(sizeof(State));
           state->snf_call_count = 0;
           func_call_ctx->user_fctx = (void *)state;
           
           /* 
            * Now we can actually switch back to the old context as State is 
            * only thing that needs to be long-lived
            */ 
       }
       
       /* Needed for every time, no idea why */
       func_call_ctx = SRF_PERCALL_SETUP();
       
       call_count_p = &((State *)func_call_ctx->user_fctx)->snf_call_count;
       
       if (*call_count_p < n) {
           ret = Int32GetDatum(*call_count_p);
           (*call_count_p) += 1;
           
           SRF_RETURN_NEXT(func_call_ctx, ret);
       } else {
           SRF_RETURN_DONE(func_call_ctx);
       }
   }
   ```
   
   WARNING: the objects stored in `func_call_ctx -> user_fctx` should all be 
   allocated in the `multi_call_memory_ctx`, if you store anything allocated
   in the transient context, you have a dangling pointer.
   
6. An example that combines composite type return value and SRF:

   ```c
   #include <ctype.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdint.h>
   
   #include "postgres.h"
   
   #include "fmgr.h"
   #include "funcapi.h"
   
   PG_MODULE_MAGIC;
   
   PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(tuple_sequence);
   Datum
   tuple_sequence(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
   {
       uint64 n;
       int32 opt_n;
       FuncCallContext * func_call_ctx;
       TupleDesc tuple_desc;
       HeapTuple heap_tuple;
       Datum values[2];
       bool is_nulls[2] = { false, false };
       uint64 index;
       Datum tuple_datum;
   
       opt_n = PG_GETARG_INT32(0);
       if (opt_n  < 0 )  {
           ereport(ERROR, errmsg("function [%s] only accepts positive number", __func__));
       } else {
           /* the cast here is safe as opt_n is positive */
           n = (uint64)opt_n;
       }
       if (get_call_result_type(fcinfo, NULL, &tuple_desc) != TYPEFUNC_COMPOSITE) {
           ereport(ERROR, errmsg("function returning record called in context that cannot accept type record”"));
       }
   
   
       if (SRF_IS_FIRSTCALL()) {
           func_call_ctx = SRF_FIRSTCALL_INIT();
       }
   
       func_call_ctx = SRF_PERCALL_SETUP();
   
       index = func_call_ctx -> call_cntr;
       if (index < n) {
           values[0] = UInt64GetDatum(index);
           values[1] = UInt64GetDatum(index);
           tuple_desc = BlessTupleDesc(tuple_desc);
           heap_tuple = heap_form_tuple(tuple_desc, values, is_nulls);
           tuple_datum = HeapTupleHeaderGetDatum(heap_tuple->t_data);
   
           SRF_RETURN_NEXT(func_call_ctx, tuple_datum);
       } else {
           SRF_RETURN_DONE(func_call_ctx);
       }
   }
   ```

   ```sql
   CREATE type foo as (
       a int4,
       b int4
   );
    
   CREATE FUNCTION tuple_sequence(n int4) RETURNS SETOF foo
   AS '$libdir/x'
   LANGUAGE C STRICT;
   ```
   
# 36.10.9. Polymorphic Arguments and Return Types

1. The type of the arguments and return value of a polymorphic function is 
   dynamic, we need to determine it at runtime:
   
   1. `Oid get_fn_expr_argtype(FmgrInfo *flinfo, int argnum)`
   
   2. `Oid get_fn_expr_rettype(FmgrInfo *flinfo)`
   
       > You can use `get_call_result_type(fcinfo, ptr_to_Oid, ptr_to_TupleDesc)`
       > as an alternative to `get_fn_expr_rettype()` since it will return the 
       > `Oid` as well when the return type is a scalar type.
   
   These 2 functions are defined in `fmgr.h`, they both return `InvalidOid` if
   the type information if not available. 
   
   > For `get_fn_expr_argtype()`, if the specified `argnum` is out of bounds, 
   > `InvalidOid` will be returned. If you simply supply a string literal or NULL
   > without providing any type information, Postgres parser cannot infer the type 
   > for you, it will complain before function `get_fn_expr_argtype()` gets called.
   
   
2. Polymorphic types other than `"any"` have to be same tyep:

   ```sql
   CREATE FUNCTION foo(a anyelement, b anyelement) RETURNS void;
   ```
   
   `a` and `b` have to be of the same type.
   

# 36.10.10. Shared Memory  

## 36.10.10.1. Requesting Shared Memory at Startup

1. Extensions can request shared memory on server startup, to do so:

   1. the shared object has to be configured in `shared_preload_libraries` so 
      that server will load it on startup.
      
      > You have to edit your `$PGDATA/postgresql.conf`
      
   2. Every extension has a `void shmem_request_hook()` hook where one can request
      the needed memory by calling `void RequestAddinShmemSpace(Size size)`. You
      should write your own `shmem_request_hook` and call `RequestAddinShmemSpace()`
      there.
      
      ```c
      void my_extension_shmem_request_hook(void) {
          RequestAddinShmemSpace(<size>); 
      }
      ```

   3. Set up the hook in `_PG_init()`:
   
      ```c
      shmem_request_hook = my_extension_shmem_request_hook;
      
      /* Or you can use:
       * 
       * shmem_request_hook = &my_extension_shmem_request_hook;
       *
       * Both &my_extension_shmem_request_hook and my_extension_shmem_request_hook
       * resolve to the address of our custom request hook function. (I don't quite 
       * love this C feature)
       */
      ```
      

## 36.10.10.2. Requesting Shared Memory After Startup
