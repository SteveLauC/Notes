1. PGXS: Postgres extension building infrastructure (for extensions written in C)

   How it works:

   Postgres has a makefile for extensions, you can "include" it in your extension's
   makefile, let's take a look at an example:

   ```makefile
   # You can have custom logic early in the file
   MODULES = isbn_issn
   EXTENSION = isbn_issn
   DATA = isbn_issn--1.0.sql
   DOCS = README.isbn_issn
   HEADERS_isbn_issn = isbn_issn.h

   # The last 3 lines should always look like this
   PG_CONFIG = pg_config
   PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
   include $(PGXS)
   ```
