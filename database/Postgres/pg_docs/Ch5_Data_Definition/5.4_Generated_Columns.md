A generated column is a column that is always computed from other columns, which 
is kinda similar to View. There are 2 kinds of generated columns:

1. stored: computed-at-write, stored on disk and occupy storage. Similar to 
   materialized view, **but it will be updated automatically**.
2. virtual: computed-at-read (by evaluator/executor). Similar to View
