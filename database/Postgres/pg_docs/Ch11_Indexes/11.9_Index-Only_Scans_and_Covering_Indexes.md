1. Not all the indexes support index-only scan, some physical requirements have 
   to be met:
   
   1. The index entries stored in the index, should provide enough information 
      to assemble the original row data.
   2. The query can only reference the columns that are indexed

2. Even an index type support IOS, Postgres still needs to scan the heap to filter
   out the rows that are invisible to the current query ('s MVCC snapshot). 
   
   Unless, Postgres knows that all the tuples in the page that an index entry point 
   to are visible to this query. This information is stored in the visibility map.
