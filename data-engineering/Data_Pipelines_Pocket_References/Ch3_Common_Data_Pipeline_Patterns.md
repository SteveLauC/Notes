1. The change from ETL to ELT

   This happened because 
   
   1. Data teams now have access to data warehouses with the storage or compute
      necessary to handle loading vast amounts of raw data and transforming it 
      into usable data models all in the same place
      
   2. Data warehourse are now columnar databases, which are more efficient in 
      handling the transformation job
