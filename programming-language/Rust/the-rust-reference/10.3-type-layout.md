1. About type layout

2. Size and Alignment

   When talking about type layout, there are basically two things:

   1. size
   2. alignment

   
   A type's alignment specifies what addresses are valid for it to store at. 
   Rules as follows:

   1. A value's starting address must be a multiple of its alignment.
   2. Alignment must be gt or eq to 1
   3. Alignment must be a power of 2

   > Use `align_of()` to get the alignment of a `Sized` type
   >
   > ```rs
   > pub const fn align_of<T>() -> usize
   > ```
   >
   > For DST, use `align_of_val()` instead:
   >
   > ```rs
   > pub fn align_of_val<T>(val: &T) -> usize
   > where
   >    T: ?Sized,
   > ```

   A type's size is how much it takes to be stored in the computer (mostly RAM), 
   it follows the following rules:

   1. A value's size is always a multiple of its alignment
      
      For zero-sized types, 0 is a multiple of any number.

   > where
   >    T: ?Sized,
   > ```

3. Primitive types layout

   | Type     |size_of::<Type>()|
   |----------|-----------------|
   |bool      | 1               |
   |u8/i8     | 1               |
   |u16/i16   | 2               |
   |u32/i32   | 4               |
   |u64/i64   | 8               |
   |u128/i128 | 8               |
   |f32       | 4               |
   |f64       | 8               |
   |char      | 4               |
   |usizeisize|8 (64bits system)|

   **Most primitives are generally aligned to their size**, although this is platform-specific 
   behavior. In particular, on x86 u64 and f64 are only aligned to 32 bits.

   ```rs
   macro_rules! size_and_align {
          ($($ty_name:ty,)*) => {
              $(
                  println!(
                      "{:5} size: {} align: {}",
                      stringify!($ty_name),
                      std::mem::size_of::<$ty_name>(),
                      std::mem::align_of::<$ty_name>()
                  );
              )*
          };
   }

   fn main() {
       size_and_align!(bool, i8, u8, u64, u16, i16, u32, i32, u64, i64, usize, isize, f32, f64, char,);
   }
   ```

   ```shell
   $ cargo r -q
   bool  size: 1 align: 1
   i8    size: 1 align: 1
   u8    size: 1 align: 1
   u64   size: 8 align: 8
   u16   size: 2 align: 2
   i16   size: 2 align: 2
   u32   size: 4 align: 4
   i32   size: 4 align: 4
   u64   size: 8 align: 8
   i64   size: 8 align: 8
   usize size: 8 align: 8
   isize size: 8 align: 8
   f32   size: 4 align: 4
   f64   size: 8 align: 8
   char  size: 4 align: 4
   ```

3. Pointer and References layout 

   > After compilation, references are just pointers so they have the same size
   > and layout.


   * Pointer to sized types have the same size and alignment as usize

     ```rs
     fn foo<T>() {
         println!("size: {} align: {}", std::mem::size_of::<&T>(), std::mem::align_of::<&T>());
     }
 
     fn main() {
         foo::<i32>();
     }
     ```

     ```shell
     $ cargo r -q
     size: 8 align: 8
     ```
  
   * Pointers to unsized types are typed. The size and alignment are guaranteed
     to be at least equal to the size and alignment of a pinter.

     > Currently, all ptrs to DSTs are twice the size of `usize` and have the same
     > alignment (as usize).
     >
     > This may change in the future, you should NOT rely on it.

     ```rs
     fn foo<T: ?Sized>() {
         println!("size: {} align: {}", std::mem::size_of::<&T>(), std::mem::align_of::<&T>());
     }
 
     fn main() {
         foo::<[u8]>();
     }
     ```

     ```shell
     $ cargo r -q
     size: 16 align: 8
     ```

4. Array layout

   An array of `[T; N]` has a size of `std::mem::size_of::<T>() * N` and the same
   alignment of `T`.

5. Slice layout `[T]`
  
   size: `std::mem::size_of::<T>() * slice.len()`
   alignment: alignment of `T`

6. `str` layout

   `str` is just `[u8]` with UTF-8 encoding so:

   size: `str.len()`
   alignment: `align_of::<u8>() = 1`

7. Tuple layout

   All the tuples are laid out according to the default representation, except for
   the unit type. 

8. Representations

   We have 4 representations in Rust:

   1. Default (or Rust representation)
   2. C (for FFI)
   3. The primitive representations

      > Only appliable to `enum`s

      ```
      #[repr(i8)]
      enum Foo {

      }
      ```
