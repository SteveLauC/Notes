#### Ch10: Time

1. The UNIX Epoch: January 1, 1970, is approximately the date (November 3, 1971)
   when the UNIX system came into being.

2. UNIX system use `time_t` to represent the seconds since `Epoch`, on 32-bit
   systems, `time_t` is an alias to `i32`, so the latest time this can represent
   is `03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038`, this is called `Year 2038 problem`.

   On 64-bit systems, this is fine as `time_t` is an alias to `i64`.

   ```rust
   pub type time_t = i64;
   ```

   > Such time represented in an absolute seconds elapsed since EPOCH is called
   > calendar time.

3. use `gettimeofday(2)` and `settimeofday(2)` to get or set calendar time

   ```c
   #include <sys/time.h>
   
   int gettimeofday(struct timeval *restrict tv, struct timezone *restrict tz);
   int settimeofday(const struct timeval *tv, const struct timezone *tz);
   ```


   These two syscalls are used to get or set time as well as timezone (not anymore).

   NOTE: argument `tz` is **obsolete** and always should be specified as `NULL`.

   ```c
   struct timeval {
       time_t      tv_sec;     /* seconds since 00:00:00, 1 Jan 1970 UTC */
       suseconds_t tv_usec;    /* microseconds */
   };

   // obsolete
   struct timezone {
       int tz_minuteswest;     /* minutes west of Greenwich */
       int tz_dsttime;         /* type of DST correction */
   };
   ```

   > Order of magnitude (time):
   >
   > (1) second = (10^3) milisecond = (10^6) microsecond = (10^9) nanosecond
   >
   > [wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(time))

   > And even though `timeval` has `microsec` precision, whether it is supported
   > is hardware dependent.

4. use `time(2)` to fetch calendar time
   
   ```c
   #include <time.h>

   time_t time(time_t *tloc);
   ```

   Returns the seconds since Epoch on success, `-1` on error.
   If `tloc` is not `NULL`, then the result is also stored in the memory pointed
   by `tloc`.

   The **ONLY** error that could happen is that `tloc` points to an invalid address.
   > EFAULT: tloc points outside your accessible address space (but see BUGS).

   So if you use `time(2)` like this, no error will happen at all:

   ```c
   time_t seconds_since_epoch = time(NULL);
   assert(seconds_since_epoch != -1);
   ```

   > The functionality of `time(2)` and `gettimeofday(2)` overlaps since `time(2)`
   > is provided by early UNIX implemention, and `gettimeofday(2)` is derived
   > from BSD.

5. use `ctime(3)` to convert `time_t` to printable form.
   
   ```c
   #include <time.h>

   // return statically allocated string terminated by '\0' and NUL.
   char *ctime(const time_t *timep);
   // put result in memory pointed by `buf`, and return `buf`.
   char *ctime_r(const time_t *restrict timep, char *restrict buf);
   ```

   These syscalls will handle `timezone` and `DST` for us automatically.

   ```c
   #include <string.h>
   #include <assert.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <time.h>
   
   int main(void)
   {
       time_t now = time(NULL);
       char buf[100];
       assert(ctime_r(&now, buf) != NULL);
       // remove the tailing newline
       long len = strlen(buf);
       buf[len - 2] = '\0';
       printf("%s\n", buf);
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   ```shell
   $ gccs main.c && ./a.out
   Thu Sep  1 07:24:26 202
   ```

6. use `gmtime(3)` and `localtime(3)` to convert `time_t` to broken-down time.

   [What is broken-down time](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Broken_002ddown-Time.html)

   ```c
   struct tm {
       int tm_sec;    /* Seconds (0-60) can be 60 to account for the leap seconds */
       int tm_min;    /* Minutes (0-59) */
       int tm_hour;   /* Hours (0-23) */
       int tm_mday;   /* Day of the month (1-31) */
       int tm_mon;    /* Month (0-11) */
       int tm_year;   /* Year - 1900 */
       int tm_wday;   /* Day of the week (0-6, Sunday = 0) */
       int tm_yday;   /* Day in the year (0-365, 1 Jan = 0) */
       int tm_isdst;  /* Daylight saving time */
   };
   ``` 

   When `_BSD_SOURCE` is defined, this struct also includes two additional fields,
   This is a BSD extension, present in 4.3BSD-Reno.

   ```
   long tm_gmtoff;           /* Seconds east of UTC */
   const char *tm_zone;      /* Timezone abbreviation */
   ```

   ```c
   struct tm *gmtime(const time_t *timep);
   struct tm *gmtime_r(const time_t *restrict timep, struct tm *restrict result);

   struct tm *localtime(const time_t *timep);
   struct tm *localtime_r(const time_t *restrict timep, struct tm *restrict result);
   ```

   Diff between `gmtime(3)` and `localtime(3)`:

   * The gmtime() function converts the calendar time timep to broken-down time
     representation, expressed in **Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**.

     > `gm` means `Greenwich Mean Time`
     > 
     > [Diff between `GMT` and `UTC`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48942916/what-is-the-difference-between-utc-and-gmt)
     > 
     > I didn't get it, but seems these two things have the same time.


   * The  localtime()  function converts the calendar time timep to broken-down
     time representation, expressed **relative to the user's specified timezone**.


   ```c
   #include <string.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <time.h>
   
   int main(void)
   {
           time_t now = time(NULL);
           struct tm buf1;
           struct tm buf2;
   
           gmtime_r(&now, &buf1);
           localtime_r(&now, &buf2);
   
           printf("gmtime_r: day: %d hour: %d\n", buf1.tm_mday, buf1.tm_hour);
           printf("localtime_r: day: %d hour: %d\n", buf2.tm_mday, buf2.tm_hour);
           return 0;
   }
   ```
   ```shell
   $ date
   Thu Sep  1 07:57:02 AM CST 2022
   
   $ gccs main.c && ./a.out
   gmtime_r: day: 31 hour: 23
   localtime_r: day: 1 hour: 7
   ```

7. use `mktime(3)` to convert *local* broken-down time to calendar time:

   ```c
   #include <time.h>

   time_t mktime(struct tm *tm);
   ```

   This function ignores the `tm_wday` and `tm_yday` fields

   > If you pass `struct tm` return by `gmtime(3)` to `mktime(3)`, `mktime(3)`
   > will return an erroneous value.

8. use `asctime(3)` to convert Broken-down time to printable form
  
   ```c
   #include <time.h>

   char *asctime(const struct tm *tm);
   char *asctime_r(const struct tm *restrict tm, char *restrict buf);
   ``` 
   
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <time.h>
   
   int main(void)
   {
           time_t now = time(NULL);
           struct tm buf1;
           struct tm buf2;
   
           gmtime_r(&now, &buf1);
           localtime_r(&now, &buf2);
   
           printf("%s\n", asctime(&buf1));
           printf("%s\n", asctime(&buf2));
           printf("%s\n", ctime(&now));
           return 0;
   }
   ```
   ```shell
   $ gccs main.c && ./a.out
   Thu Sep  1 01:57:57 2022
   
   Thu Sep  1 09:57:57 2022
   
   Thu Sep  1 09:57:57 2022
   ```

9. use `strftime(3)` to convert `broken-down time` to printable form with
   **more precision**

   ```c
   #include <time.h>

   size_t strftime(char *restrict s, size_t max, 
                   const char *restrict format, 
                   const struct tm *restrict tm);
   ```

10. use `strptime(3)` to convert `printable form` to `broken-down time`

    > reverse of `strftime(3)`

    ```c
    #define _XOPEN_SOURCE       /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
    #include <time.h>

    char *strptime(const char *restrict s, 
                   const char *restrict format,
                   struct tm *restrict tm);
    ```

    The glibc implementation of `strptime(3)` will not modify those fields of the
    `tm` structure that are not initialized by specifiers in `format`. This is not
    portable, so we should ensure that all the fields of `tm` are initialzed validly
    in portable programs.

    `tm_isdst` field is not set.

11. use `setlocale(3)` to get or set locale setting

12. Timezone

    Timezone info can be volatile so that rather than hanling it directly in program, 
    the system maintains this information in files in standard formats.

    And the files reside under `/usr/share/zoneinfo`, each file in this directory
    contains information about the timezone reginme in a particular country or
    region.

    > `/usr/share/zoneinfo` can be changed to another directory via `$TZDIR`, this
    > is a GNU extension.

    ```
    ❯ l /usr/share/zoneinfo|head -5
    Permissions Size User Group Date Modified Name
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root  29 Aug 07:42  Africa
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root  29 Aug 07:42  America
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root  29 Aug 07:42  Antarctica
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root  29 Aug 07:42  Arctic
    ```

    The format of above file can be found at `man 5 tcfile`, and these files are
    built using `zic(8)`, the timezone compiler. `zdump(8)` command can be used
    to display the current time corresponding to a specific timezone file:

    ```shell
    $ zdump Cuba
    Cuba  Sat Sep  3 23:01:09 2022 CDT
    ```

    Local timezone is stored in file `/etc/localtime`, which is a softlink to
    the timezone file under `/usr/share/zoninfo`:

    ```shell
    $ l /etc/localtime
    Permissions Size User Group Date Modified Name
    lrwxrwxrwx@   35 root root  25 Aug 06:05  /etc/localtime -> ../usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai
    ```

13. obtain timezone info in a program

    ```c
    #include <time.h>

    void tcset(void)
    ``` 

    This function will set 3 global variables:

    ```c
    extern char *tzname[2];
    extern long timezone;
    extern int daylight;
    ```

    The mechanism behind this function: it first query `$TZ` environment variable,
    if this is not set, then it uses `/etc/timezone`.

    If `$TZ` is empty (set but empty) or it's format is not valid, then `UTC` will
    be used.

    Those time-related functions (e.g. ctime(), localtime()) will call `tzset`
    automatically.

14. change timezone for program - change $TZ

    > Normally, you don't need to modify this variable unless you are operating
    > a remove machine whose timezone differs from your localhost.

    ```shell
    $ date
    Sun Sep  4 11:28:00 AM CST 2022
    $ TZ=":Cuba" date
    Sat Sep  3 11:28:13 PM CDT 2022
    ``` 

    These are two ways to change `$TZ` in SUSv3, first is demonstrated above, a colon 
    following the relative path (from /usr/share/zoneinfo) of the target timezone file.

    The second way is rather cumbersome. You can refer to 
    [this](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/TZ-Variable.html)

15. locale: conventions on how to express things

    > For example, in US, date is expressed as `MM/DD/YY`. While in China, we
    > use `YY/MM/DD`.

    Ideally, all programs should respect this.

    As same as timezone, locale settings is volatile, which should be maintained
    by the OS. And it is.

    The setting files reside under `/usr/share/locale` or `/usr/lib/locale` (distro
    dependent)

    ```shell
    $ l /usr/share/locale | head -5
    Permissions Size User Group Date Modified Name
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root   9 Aug 21:57  aa
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root   9 Aug 21:57  ab
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root   9 Aug 21:57  ace
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root   9 Aug 21:57  ach
    ```

    Each directory under `/usr/share/locale` is named in such convention:

    ```
    language[_territory[.codeset]][@modifier]
    ```

    * language: a two-letter ISO language code
    * territory: two-letter ISO country code
    * codeset: character-encoding set
    * modifier: used to distinguish multiple locales whose `language/territory/
      codeset` are all same

    ```shell
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root  25 Aug 14:27  zh_CN
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root   9 Aug 21:57  zh_CN.GB2312
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root  25 Aug 14:54  zh_CN.UTF-8
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root   5 May 05:27  zh_Hans
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root   5 May 05:27  zh_Hant
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root   9 Aug 21:57  zh_HK
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root   9 Aug 21:57  zh_TW
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root   9 Aug 21:57  zh_TW.Big5
    drwxr-xr-x@    - root root  25 Aug 14:54  zh_TW.UTF-8
    ```

16. list current lcoale settings
    
    ```shell
    $ locale
    LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_ALL=
    ```

    `locale -a` can list all the locales supported by current system.

17. set or get the locale of current process

    ```c
    #include <locale.h>

    char *setlocale(int category, const char *locale);
    ```

    ```
    Category            Governs
    LC_ALL              All of the locale
    LC_ADDRESS          Formatting of addresses and geography-related items (*)
    LC_COLLATE          String collation
    LC_CTYPE            Character classification
    LC_IDENTIFICATION   Metadata describing the locale (*)
    LC_MEASUREMENT      Settings related to measurements (metric versus US customary) (*)
    LC_MESSAGES         Localizable natural-language messages
    LC_MONETARY         Formatting of monetary values
    LC_NAME             Formatting of salutations for persons (*)
    LC_NUMERIC          Formatting of nonmonetary numeric values
    LC_PAPER            Settings related to the standard paper size (*)
    LC_TELEPHONE        Formats to be used with telephone services (*)
    LC_TIME             Formatting of date and time values
    ```
    
    If `locale` is a empty string, then the locale is set according to the values
    of the current environment variables. The process will know nothing about
    these environement variables unless we manually call `setlocale(category, "");`.

    > If one of them is set, then the whole setting of locale is set to that value.

    If `locale` is `NULL`, then the locale is just queried, not modified.
 
    When we say specify or set a locale, we are talking about setting locale
    to a subdir of `/usr/share/locale`. If the new locale value does not match
    any item in `/usr/share/locale`, then the new locale will be stripped in
    the following orders to get a match:

    1. codeset
    2. normalized codeset
    3. territory
    4. modifier

    If no one matches after all these 4 strippings, `setlocale()` will report an
    error.

    We can test this:

    ```c
    #include <locale.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
            char *old_locale = setlocale(LC_ALL, NULL);
            printf("old_locale: \"%s\"\n", old_locale);
    
            char *new_locale = "wc_CN.utf-8";
            char *res = setlocale(LC_ALL, new_locale);
            if (res == NULL) {
                    printf("\"%s\" is not a valid locale\n", new_locale);
            }
            return 0;
    }
    ```

    ```shell
    $ gccs main.c && ./a.out
    old_locale: "C"
    "wc_CN.utf-8" is not a valid locale
    ```

    `setlocale(LC_ALL, "C")` will be called at the startup of a program.

18. priority of those locale-related environmen variables
    
    ```
    LC_ALL > LC_* > LANG
    ```

    If a variable with higher priority is set, the the less priviledged
    ones will be shadowed.
