#### Ch10: Time

1. The UNIX Epoch: January 1, 1970, is approximately the date (November 3, 1971)
   when the UNIX system came into being.

2. UNIX system use `time_t` to represent the seconds since `Epoch`, on 32-bit
   systems, `time_t` is an alias to `i32`, so the latest time this can represent
   is `03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038`, this is called `Year 2038 problem`.

   On 64-bit systems, this is fine as `time_t` is an alias to `i64`.

   ```rust
   pub type time_t = i64;
   ```

3. `gettimeofday(2)` and `settimeofday(2)`

   ```c
   #include <sys/time.h>
   
   int gettimeofday(struct timeval *restrict tv, struct timezone *restrict tz);
   int settimeofday(const struct timeval *tv, const struct timezone *tz);
   ```


   These two syscalls are used to get or set time as well as timezone (not anymore).

   NOTE: argument `tz` is **obsolete** and always should be specified as `NULL`.

   ```c
   struct timeval {
       time_t      tv_sec;     /* seconds since 00:00:00, 1 Jan 1970 UTC */
       suseconds_t tv_usec;    /* microseconds */
   };

   // obsolete
   struct timezone {
       int tz_minuteswest;     /* minutes west of Greenwich */
       int tz_dsttime;         /* type of DST correction */
   };
   ```

4. `time(2)`
   
   ```c
   #include <time.h>

   time_t time(time_t *tloc);
   ```

   Returns the seconds since Epoch on success, `-1` on error.
   If `tloc` is not `NULL`, then the result is also stored in the memory pointed
   by `tloc`.

   The **ONLY** error that could happen is that `tloc` points to an invalid address.
   > EFAULT: tloc points outside your accessible address space (but see BUGS).

   So if you use `time(2)` like this, no error will happen at all:

   ```c
   time_t seconds_since_epoch = time(NULL);
   assert(seconds_since_epoch != -1);
   ```

   > The functionality of `time(2)` and `gettimeofday(2)` overlaps since `time(2)`
   > is provided by early UNIX implemention, and `gettimeofday(2)` is derived
   > from BSD.

5. use `ctime(3)` to convert `time_t` to printable form.
   
   ```c
   #include <time.h>

   // return statically allocated string terminated by '\0' and NUL.
   char *ctime(const time_t *timep);
   // put result in memory pointed by `buf`, and return `buf`.
   char *ctime_r(const time_t *restrict timep, char *restrict buf);
   ```

   These syscalls will handle `timezone` and `DST` for us automatically.
