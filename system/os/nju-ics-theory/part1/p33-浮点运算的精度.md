1. 由于浮点数在运算的时候会不断的丢失精度，所以我们在给浮点数加上附加位来留住精度。
   IEEE754规定，必须在中间结果的右边加两个附加位(guard and round)

   这几个位的默认值是0，在运算或者对阶移动或者非规格化尾数或者尾数溢出的时候就会发
   挥作用。比如在右规时可以用来保护位，左规时被移动到mantissa中，作为舍入的依据。

2. 举个十进制小数的例子来说明附加位对精度的影响

3. IEEE754的4种舍入模型

   Rounding floating-point numbers
   The IEEE standard has four different rounding modes; the first is the default;
   the others are called directed roundings.

   1. Round to Nearest – rounds to the nearest value; 
   > if the number falls midway it is rounded to the nearest value with an 
   *even* (zero) least significant bit, which means it is rounded up 50% of the
   time (in IEEE 754-2008 this mode is called roundTiesToEven to distinguish it 
   from another round-to-nearest mode)

   2. Round toward 0 – directed rounding towards zero
   3. Round toward +∞ – directed rounding towards positive infinity
   4. Round toward −∞ – directed rounding towards negative infinity.
