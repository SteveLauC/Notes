Arms bent in a low and aggressive body positioning. Back straight, hinged at the hip. Chin over your bars. You want your weight centered or even slightly biased forward (this is very counter intuitive). Keeping your weight slightly biased forward applies weight to your front tire, allowing you to retain traction and giving you more control.

Biasing forward also gives you more bend in your elbows, allowing you to have better bike-body separation.

Getting back on the bike does two things you don't want. One, it unweights the front tire, making it washy and harder to retain traction. Two, it straightens your arms and reduces your ability to move the bike around and respond to obstacles and corners. Getting back on the bike turns you into a passenger.

Front heel dropped to brace against the slope.

Use more front brake. In steep loose terrain, your rear brake is virtually useless. It skids and breaks traction much easier. It is much harder to skid your front. You can use both, but use the rear more sparingly. If you begin to skid, release your brake.

Note that when you are braking on steep sections, then you should shift your weight back a little bit.
