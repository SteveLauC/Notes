When to brake:

When not to brake:

Do not brake when you need *directional* grip:

1. corner
2. off-camber (what is this?)
3. Anywhere you need your suspension to work best


Braking posture:

1. Straignten your arm
2. Move your weight backwards
3. Dip your heels to be more aggressive
4. Back to the standing position right when you start to the brake 
   **or your bike get away from you**, they should be done at the same
   time
