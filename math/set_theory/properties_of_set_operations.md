1. Commutatiive property of union and intersection

   $$ A \cup B = B \cup A  $$
   $$ A \cap B = B \cap A  $$

2. Associative property of union and intersection

   $$ (A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C) $$
   $$ (A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C) $$

3. Distributive property of union and intersection

   1. Union distributes over intersecion

      $$ A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) $$
    
   2. Intersection distributes over union

      $$ A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) $$

4. Cartesian product distributes over 

   1. union 
   2. intersection
   3. Set difference

   $$ A \times (B \cup C) = (A \times B) \cup (A \times C) $$ 
   $$ A \times (B \cap C) = (A \times B) \cap (A \times C) $$ 
   $$ A \times (B \setminus C) = (A \times B) \setminus (A \times C) $$
